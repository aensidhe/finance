# What is it?

Various tools for converting bank statements from various hideous formats to csv or xlsx.

# Why?

Lots of analysis tools can import csv or xlsx, but can't import html, pdf, docs of whatever hideous format your bank using for statements. Not to mention the fact that Excel is great analytical tool by itself.
